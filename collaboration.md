# Clouds and their Climatic Impacts

Sylvia led the editing of a new volume available since December 2023 through AGU Geophysical Monographs on _Clouds and their Climatic Impacts_ with Corinna Hoose at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). It is available through [Wiley](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Clouds+and+Their+Climatic+Impact%3A+Radiation%2C+Circulation%2C+and+Precipitation-p-9781119700319), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Clouds-their-Climatic-Impact-Precipitation/dp/1119700310/ref=sr_1_1?crid=9KB5FH7KEM9Z&keywords=clouds+and+their+climatic+impact&qid=1702921601&sprefix=clouds+and+their+climatic+impac%2Caps%2C299&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.17d9e15d-4e43-4581-b373-0e5c1a776d5d), and [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/book/1143372658). A short piece was published on it [here](https://eos.org/editors-vox/the-complexity-of-clouds-circulation-and-climate) by Editors' Vox blog at AGU, as well as an editorial from KIT [here](https://www.imk-tro.kit.edu/12521.php).

## Hydrological studies

I have been lucky to work with Dr. Jiabo Yin and others at Wuhan University on several hydrological studies, discussing the intensification of runoff, drought, and flooding both globally and in China.
