# NASA EXCITE Project

We are using Tucson AERONET site data as part of the University of Arizona's NASA EXCITE project, focused on exposing more students to atmospheric science and promoting ground-based atmospheric observations. See [this webpage](https://uavip.arizona.edu/excite-nasa-measurements-study-earth) for a description of our activities and a Behind the Scenes video with our EXCITE participants in Tucson.

# Collaboration with the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH)

In 2026, Juliana Mejia, a graduate student in our group traveled down to King George Island, Antarctica in February 2026 to help maintain the ground-based measurement site of the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH). They are measuring surface temperature and wind speeds, atmospheric fluxes, and aerosol properties along the Antarctic peninsula. INACH posted an article about her participation [here](https://www.inach.cl/monitorean-desde-la-antartica-el-impacto-global-del-humo-de-los-incendios-forestales/)!

# Clouds and their Climatic Impacts

Sylvia led the editing of a new volume available since December 2023 through AGU Geophysical Monographs on _Clouds and their Climatic Impacts_ with Corinna Hoose at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). It is available through [Wiley](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Clouds+and+Their+Climatic+Impact%3A+Radiation%2C+Circulation%2C+and+Precipitation-p-9781119700319), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Clouds-their-Climatic-Impact-Precipitation/dp/1119700310/ref=sr_1_1?crid=9KB5FH7KEM9Z&keywords=clouds+and+their+climatic+impact&qid=1702921601&sprefix=clouds+and+their+climatic+impac%2Caps%2C299&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.17d9e15d-4e43-4581-b373-0e5c1a776d5d), and [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/book/1143372658). A short piece was published on it [here](https://eos.org/editors-vox/the-complexity-of-clouds-circulation-and-climate) by Editors' Vox blog at AGU, as well as an editorial from KIT [here](https://www.imk-tro.kit.edu/12521.php).

## Hydrological studies

We have worked with Dr. Jiabo Yin and others at Wuhan University on several hydrological studies, discussing the intensification of runoff, drought, and flooding both globally and in China.
